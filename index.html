            <li>2 Small Free Range Eggs</li>
            <li>2 Garlic Gloves</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Begin by slicing 30 grams of grass-beef filet in half. Don't remove
            any fat as this helps give the beef it's cooked texture. Next,
            thoroughly tenderize both slices with a small wooden tenderizer. Be
            sure to use greaseproof paper! Prepare a pan with a table-spoon of
            olive-oil. Add black pepper to the oil and heat the pan to 150
            degrees celsius. Now carefully place the beef into the pan-adding
            sea-salt while turning the beef every 30 seconds for 2 minutes.
            Remove the beef and place each filet on it's own plate. Leave the
            pan at 150 degrees celsius. Now crush 2 cloves of garlic and
            sprinkle generously over the beef. Crack 2 eggs into the pan. They
            will be infused with the juices of the filets. Pour 1/2 a glass of
            water into the pan and place a lid on the pan for approximately 45
            seconds. remove the cooked eggs and place each one on a beef slice.
            And there you have it! Perfect steak and eggs every time!

        <h2>Detroit-Style Pizza</h2>
        <p>
          Everything you need to know to make an amazing Detroit-Style Pizza in
          your own oven! This delicious pan pizza is hugely popular for a
          reason, and this homemade version will have you feeling like a pro!
          It’s baked to perfection with a chewy, bubbly crust and crisp cheesy
          edges. A true Detroit style pizza is baked in a seasoned steel pan.
          This is my kids absolute favorite pizza and it’s impossible to stop
          after just one slice.
        </p>

          <h3>Ingredients for one pizza</h3>
          <h5>Dough:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>236.59 g lukewarm water</li>
            <li>1.5 g instant yeast</li>
            <li>312.5 g bread flour</li>
            <li>5.5 g ground sea salt</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Pizza Sauce:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup Pizza Sauce</li>
            <li>
              282.5 g shredded low moisture mozzarella cheese , or 8oz Brick
              cheese/Wisconsin cheese, diced
            </li>
            <li>85.05 g natural casing Pepperoni , thinly sliced</li>
            <li>25 g freshly shredded parmesan cheese</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Make dough:</strong> Stir all ingredients together in a
              bowl or stand mixer. Knead for several minutes, until the dough is
              smooth and elastic.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>First rise:</strong> Place in a well-greased bowl, turning
              once in the bowl to coat in oil, then cover and allow to rise for
              2 hours. (Don't skimp on the rise times!)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Press into pan:</strong> Oil the bottom and sides of a
              pizza pan*. Stretch dough into a rectangle and lay into pan(s).
              Cover and rest for 15 minutes, to allow the gluten to relax.
              Without handling the dough too much, gently spread the dough all
              the way to the edges of the pan, poking it into the corners, in a
              flat even layer (there’s no “crust” edge in Detroit pizza).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Second rise:</strong> Rise again for 2 hours, or until the
              dough has risen about ⅓ way up the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Preheat oven</strong> to 450 degrees F. I recommend baking
              the pizza on a pizza stone, or if you don't have a pizza stone,
              use a baking sheet, and allow it to preheat in the oven.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Add cheese:</strong> sprinkle cheese all over the dough,
              making sure it covers all the way to the edges.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Add sauce:</strong> spoon pizza sauce into 2-3
              lines/stripes going down the pan, over cheese—you don't want to
              cover all the cheese in sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Add pepperoni,</strong> laying it in a single layer over
              the top. Lightly sprinkle parmesan on top.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Bake</strong> for 15-20 minutes, or until cheese is golden
              and bubbly. Cool for a few minutes in the pan before slicing into
              squares.

          <ul>
            <li>255g all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp Sea salt</li>
            <li>225g mashed potatoes, boiled in salted water</li>
            <li>225g grated raw potato</li>
            <li>230 ml buttermilk (or more if needed)</li>
            <li>butter for the pan</li>
          </ul>
          <ol>
            <li>
              In a small bowl, place the flour, baking powder and salt, set
              aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a large mixing bowl, combine the mashed potatoes with the
              grated raw potato, then add the flour and mix well.
            </li>
            <li>
              Slowly add the buttermilk and stir gently (do not over mix).
            </li>
            <li>
              The mixture should be like a very firm, thick batter, almost like
              a dough, so add more buttermilk if needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat a nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat, and add a pat of
              butter, just before scooping out some of the boxty batter onto the
              pan.
            </li>
            <li>
              Flatten and shape into a nice, round pancake shape and fry until
              golden brown on the bottom.
            </li>
            <li>
              Turn and continue to cook until golden brown on top too, turning
              the heat down if they are browning too quickly (remember there are
              raw potatoes which need to cook).
            </li>
            <li>
              Continue to add a little butter and fry the boxty until all the
              batter is finished.
